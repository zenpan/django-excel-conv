  <p>which results in an exported Excel spreadsheet with numbered debtors, names followed by their LexisID,
    an address all in one cell, filing information and the creditor. This application takes that spreadsheet
    and converts it to an Excel spreadsheet that can be used to perform a MailMerge into a Word document.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the spreadsheet must be in the same format as the one provided by the
      Public Records search. The spreadsheet must be saved as a .xlsx file and the file must be uploaded
      to the application using the upload page.</p>
    <p>Once the spreadsheet is uploaded, the user will be redirected to the jobs page where the user 
      can view the status of the job and run the conversion by clicking "convert". The user will then 
      be able to download the converted spreadsheet after the job is complete.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the time to convert the spreadsheet can take up to <strong>1 minute</strong>. </p>
